- Understood how to interpret the elbow curve.

### Difficulties Faced
- Identifying the exact "elbow" point in some cases.
- Ensuring the chosen K value provides meaningful clusters.

### Final Thought
The Elbow Method is a valuable tool for determining K, but domain knowledge is crucial for final decisions.

## Task 6: Handling High-Dimension Data

### What I Learned
- Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality before clustering.
- Understood the trade-off between dimensionality reduction and information retention.
- Visualized clusters in a reduced feature space.

### Difficulties Faced
- Choosing the right number of principal components.
- Ensuring meaningful cluster separation in a lower-dimensional space.

### Final Thought
Dimensionality reduction enhances clustering efficiency, but careful selection of principal components is required.

### What I Learned
- Experimented with different distance metrics and initialization strategies.
- Compared K-means++ with random initialization.
- Explored alternative clustering algorithms for comparison.

### Difficulties Faced
- Evaluating clustering quality beyond visual inspection.
- Handling cases where K-means failed to converge optimally.

### Final Thought
Variations in K-means influence clustering performance, highlighting the importance of algorithm selection.

## Task 8: Anomaly Detection with K-means

### What I Learned
- Used K-means to detect anomalies based on distance from centroids.
- Understood how outliers affect clustering results.
- Explored applications of anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.

### Difficulties Faced
- Setting a meaningful threshold for anomaly identification.
- Differentiating between genuine anomalies and natural variations.

### Final Thought
K-means can serve as a basic anomaly detection tool, but defining an appropriate distance threshold is crucial.
