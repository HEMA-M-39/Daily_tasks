### Difficulties Faced  
- Balancing complexity vs. overfitting when increasing polynomial degrees.  
- Choosing the right polynomial degree to improve model accuracy.  

### Final Thought  
Polynomial regression is a powerful tool for modeling non-linearity, but finding the right balance between accuracy and overfitting is key.

## Task 7: Outlier Impact  

### What I Learned  
- Explored different methods to detect and handle outliers (IQR, Z-score, visualization).  
- Understood how outliers can distort regression models.  
- Learned how removing or transforming outliers affects predictions.  

### Difficulties Faced  
- Deciding when to remove vs. retain outliers based on business context.  
- Understanding how outliers influence regression coefficients.  

### Final Thought  
Outliers significantly impact regression models, and handling them requires a balance between preserving data integrity and improving model performance.

## Task 8: Regularization Implementation  

### What I Learned  
- Implemented Ridge and Lasso regression to handle overfitting.  
- Understood how regularization penalizes complex models to improve generalization.  
- Explored the trade-off between model complexity and predictive power.  

### Difficulties Faced  
- Choosing the optimal regularization strength (`alpha` value) for Ridge and Lasso.  
- Interpreting Lasso’s feature selection impact when coefficients shrink to zero.  

### Final Thought  
Regularization is crucial for controlling overfitting, especially in complex models with multiple predictors. Finding the right penalty term is key to balancing accuracy and generalizability.

## Task 9 (Bonus): Real-world Application  

### What I Learned  
- Applied regression techniques to a real-world dataset.  
- Understood how to define business problems that benefit from regression analysis.  
- Explored how insights from regression can drive decision-making.  

### Difficulties Faced  
- Ensuring data relevance and quality before building the model.
